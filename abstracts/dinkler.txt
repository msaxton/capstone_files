Despite the recent spate of scholarly publications related to characterization in
New Testament narratives, no consensus has been reached. Scholars cannot
agree on whether Lukes Jesus is characterized primarily as a teacher, as the Messiah,
or as a rival to Caesar. Neither can scholars agree on whether Lukes disciples
are flat paradigms of positive or negative behavior or on whether Luke liberates,
oppresses, or sends “double messages” about women, the poor, and those who
need healing. Some read Lukes religious and political authorities as uniformly
negative “stock” characters, while others contend that they are more nuanced and
complex. Contemporary theorists of characterization outside of biblical studies
have focused on different questions from those typically asked by New Testament
scholars. I contend that literary theorists’ proposed solutions to their questions
can profitably shift our considerations of characterization in New Testament
narratives. This article proceeds in three movements. First, I sketch several
trends in New Testament studies of characterization. Second, I describe three
theoretical premises shared by many contemporary literary theorists regarding
characterization. Finally, I consider how taking these literary-theoretical orientations
as points of departure can shift the terms of our discussions of New Testament
characterization. The illustrative text throughout is Luke 24:13-35, in
which the risen Jesus meets the disciple Cleopas and his anonymous companion
on the road to Emmaus.
