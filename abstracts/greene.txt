This article proposes a tripartite structure of Psalm 74. The proposal is based on
various lexical and syntactic features ofthe psalmist’s lament and sheds light on
both the interpretation ofthe psalm as a whole and the interpretation of verses
12-17 in particular. It argues that these verses were interpolated to express a
particular cosmogonic temple theology. When the psalm is viewed alongside
comparable ancient Near Eastern literature from loci such as Ugarit, potential
motives for this interpolation become evident. ٠e interpolator sought to
sharpen the petition to God by drawing on older, Canaanite mythology in hopes
that such rhetorical maneuvers might occasion an acceptable solution to the
psalmist’s lament.
