According to the overwhelming majority of modern English Bible translations,
the proscriptions of male-on-male sexual intercourse in Lev 18:22 and 20:13
appear to be directed to the activity of the insertive party, the few remaining
versions simply proscribing male-on-male sex in such a general way that there
is no indication one way or the other as to whose activity is being addressed.
Jerome T. Walsh has challenged the status quo, however, persuasively arguing
that, when correctly interpreted, the Hebrew text indicates that it is instead the
activity ofthe receptive party that is being addressed (“Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13:
Who Is Doing What to Whom?,”/£L 120 [2001]: 201-9). Building on the foundation
laid by Walsh, the present work analyzes the two verses in their immediate
Hebrew context and applies the same analysis to the earliest translations, the
result being a validation ofWalshs contention that the proscriptions were indeed
directed to the activity ofthe receptive rather than the insertive party.
